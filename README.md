This was a job search web app, coming from the idea of searching for a job that can suit your needs. Multiple filter options making the job search easier. I used the Muse API with get requests in order to display the information. The context API was used to put everything in one file and distribute the necessary states. This was my first introduction to React Hooks. The use of hooks allowed me to redefine the usage of react and it's state architecture.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Sass, Javascript, Typescript

**Server:** Muse API

## Lessons Learned

This was my second big project. I incorporated react hooks with the context API for state management. I did all the GET requests in one file and distributed the necessary logic to the adequate components. My first introduction to an external API and typescript. I liked the user interface and type system as it permitted me to debug much easier. Lessons learned are react hooks and API requests for external servers.
